   How to Make Friends and Influence People is the second album by the rock band Terrorvision, released in 1994 on Total Vegas Recordings. "Oblivion", "Middleman", "Pretend Best Friend", "Alice What's the Matter", and "Some People Say" were all released as singles. The title refers to the Dale Carnegie book How to Win Friends and Influence People. The album was recorded in 17 days.  How to Make Friends and Influence People was recorded with producer Gil Norton and engineer Al Clay; they were assisted by engineer Mike Cyr. Norton and Chris Sheldon mixed the album at The Church in London, with assistance from Elliot Ness and John McDonnell.[8]  The 15th anniversary of the release of the album was commemorated by tours in April and December 2009, whereby the band played the entire album from start to finish; the first time the album has been played live in its entirety. During the first leg of the tour, at the larger venues a recording of the show was available for purchase immediately afterwards.  The album was played in full again in May 2019 during a short UK tour to commemorate its 25th anniversary.[9]  All tracks written by Terrorvision.[8]  The hidden track is a very low quality collection of sounds recorded by the band in New York,  where the album was recorded.
