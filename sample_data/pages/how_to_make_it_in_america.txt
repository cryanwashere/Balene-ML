 How to Make It in America is an American comedy-drama television series that ran on HBO from February 14, 2010, to November 20, 2011. The series follows the lives of Ben Epstein (Bryan Greenberg) and his friend Cam Calderon (Victor Rasuk) as they try to succeed in New York City's fashion scene. The show's second season premiered on October 2, 2011.[1]  On December 20, 2011, HBO announced the cancellation of the show citing failure to generate a large audience and buzz.[2] Executive producer Mark Wahlberg expressed hope in an interview for GQ magazine in January 2012 that the show would return on another network.[3]  How to Make it in America followed two enterprising twenty year olds hustling their way through New York City's talent show, determined to achieve their vision of the American dream. Trying to make a name for themselves in New York's competitive fashion scene, Ben Epstein (Greenberg) and his friend and business partner Cam Calderon (Rasuk) use their street knowledge and connections to bring their ambitions to fruition. With the help of Cam's cousin Rene (Guzman), who is trying to market his own high-energy drink, and their well-connected friend Domingo ("Kid Cudi"), the entrepreneurs set out to make it big, encountering obstacles along the way that will require all their ingenuity to overcome.  Ian Edelman wrote the pilot, which the Entourage crew of Mark Wahlberg, Stephen Levinson, Rob Weiss and Julian Farino executive produced. Edelman and Jada Miranda were also executive producers.[4] "This show is a fun ride through the downtown scene, examining the cross section of people and how they relate to the relevant subcultures in NYC," Weiss, who was executive producing the pilot, told the Hollywood Reporter.[5]  HBO made a free early online-only premiere available on various video sites including iTunes and YouTube.[6] Season 2 premiered on HBO on October 2, 2011.  The opening title sequence was created by Isaac Lobe and directing duo Josh & Xander and produced by @radical.media. The theme song, "I Need a Dollar", was performed by Aloe Blacc of Stones Throw Records.[7] Shot in New York City, the sequence comprises a video and photography montage, bringing together the show's underlying themes of "grit, hunger, ambition, the multicultural whirl of New York and the culture-transcending pursuit of the almighty dollar".[8]  The first season received mixed reviews. On Metacritic it has a score of 60% based on reviews from 26 critics.[20]  David Hinkley of the New York Daily News gave the show a positive review, giving the show 4/5 stars, and calling it a "winner".[21] Brian Lowry of Variety was doubtful of the series, stating "barring a dramatic leap in quality" it probably wouldn't last on pay cable.[22] Mark Perigard of the Boston Herald wrote critically, saying "this sad sack of a show plays like an East Coast, economically challenged version of his HBO hit Entourage."[23] Randee Dawn of The Hollywood Reporter said the show "isn't as textured and riveting as it thinks it is".[24][better source needed] Other reviews favored the show in comparison to Entourage.[25]  The second season did not get much positive reception. On Metacritic only two reviews are listed but both reviews are positive.[26] Maureen Ryan of Huffington Post wrote the show has "a little more discipline and focus than they did in season 1."[27] Phillip Maciak of Slant Magazine also added that the show is "anchored by gorgeous production design and the pop naturalism of its performances, How to Make It in America dramatizes this particular cultural moment with uncommon style and a little grace as well."[28]
